/**
 * TransformFactory catalogues both "installed" transforms (based on
 * plugins available to load) and "uninstalled" ones (based on RDF or
 * other metadata, possibly found online).
 *
 * You can retrieve a list of properties of either of these, and given
 * a transform ID, the TransformFactory can tell you whether the
 * transform is installed, not yet installed, or unknown. You can also
 * search both transform catalogues by keyword.
 *
 * TransformFactory can also construct the plugin for a transform,
 * transfer parameter bundles back and forth from plugin to transform,
 * and return various information about a transform. (These
 * capabilities are for installed transforms only. If a method name
 * contains "Transform" without qualification, it refers only to
 * installed ones.)
 *
 * The process of populating the transform catalogues can be handled
 * synchronously or asynchronously. There are two optional population
 * threads, for installed and uninstalled transforms, which can be
 * started with startPopulatingInstalledTransforms() and
 * startPopulatingUninstalledTransforms() respectively. Signals
 * installedTransformsPopulated and uninstalledTransformsPopulated are
 * emitted by each when they complete.
 *
 * If a function is called which depends on either installed or
 * uninstalled transforms having been populated, at a time when
 * population is not complete, it will first populate them, either by
 * waiting for the population thread or by populating them
 * synchronously. The exceptions are the search functions, which do
 * not wait for uninstalled transforms to finish populating - they may
 * just return incomplete data in that case.
